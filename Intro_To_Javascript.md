# Javascript Crash Tutorial Highlights


### Javascript is a

> Highlevel, interpreted programming language
> Conforms ECMAScript specification
> Multi-paradigm
> Runs on client/browser as well as on server (Node.js)


###### Highlevel - 
Unlike C / C++ which are low level languages which depend on/interact with the operating system, 
Javascript has a lot of abstraction. We don't have to deal with any memory management etc...

###### Interpreted - 
Javascript can be run directly without having to compile using a compiler unlike Java which uses a compiler to compile its code before it could be run. Javascript is a scripting language and it is interpreted.

###### ECMAScript -  
It was created to standardize JavaScript, so as to foster multiple independent implementations.

###### Multi-paradigm - 
Meaning, Javascript can be written in many ways.. example: Object-oriented/function codes and not many strict rules to follow while writing a Javascript code like having to follow a certain way.

###### client/browser -
Javascript is a frontend programming language. Mostly used for interactive aspects like form validations, showing alerts to user...etc



### Advantages of using Javascript

> Runs on the browser/is a client-side programming language
> Build interactive interfaces
> Used in building very fast server-side/full-stack application
> Used in Mobile Applications (React Native/NativeScript/Ionic)
> USed in Desktop Application Development (Electron JS)



### Important Topics to learn Javascript ::

> Variables & Data types
> Arrays
> Object Literals
> Methods for Strings, Arrays, Objects, etc
> Loops
> Conditionals
> Functions
> OOP (Prototypes & Classes)
> DOM Selection
> DOM Manipulation
> Events
> Basic Form Validations



Javascript can be inserted inline in an HTML file but most recomended/industry standards would be to have a seperate .js file and include it in the HTML file (but towards the end of HTML file.

[EXAMPLE] (/JS_Files/SampleJS.js)(/HTML_Files/LearnJS.html)

> console.log("")
> console.error("")
> console.warning("")

are some of the functions that can be used for debug purposes.
